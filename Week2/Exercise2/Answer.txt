	Although the discussion of project size (in terms of bits) as it relates to version management software is
undoubtedly one that is debated among IT professionals, my stance on the matter is that size is nearly irrelevant
to whether version control should be used or not. Granted, if a project is significant in size, say for example
several Gigabytes of raw code, then version control should certainly be implemented. However, I would not say
that it is due to the size itself, but rather the amount of time that could be lost should something break,
or be lost entirely. For example, if an equally large project was the product of open-source code, with only a
couple of lines of code injected for testing purposes, then that may not merit the use of version control.

	On the contrary, a very small project, such as one that is less than 100KB, used by a networking team to
push configuration settings out to their network devices would absolutely benefit from the use of version control.
Although that size of a project may seem negligible, version control would benefit the team by assisting with
the monitoring of configuration drift, as well as accounting. So, it stands to reason that the size of a file,
